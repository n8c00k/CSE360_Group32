Installing JavaFX:
	We all need JavaFX installed on our computers for the project to be able to compile on your end.
	If you are working on GUI visual layout then you will also need to install SceneBuilder.
	
	Install JavaFX w/ Eclipse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7OM-cMYWbQ
	Link SceneBuilder w/ Eclipse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yngO5WwfZCY
	
	I recommend watching both before doing anything.
	
Extra install notes:
	The Install location for JavaFX was set up as C:\Program Files\Java\Extenstions

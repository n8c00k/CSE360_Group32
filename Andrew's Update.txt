Reminders:

We now have about 2 weeks to get the entire application done and tested. it's Due 4/5

Since no one has updated the github ask to see peoples updates

if not much progress has been made
	let them know this-
	I know that life and work can be busy but their work here not only affects their grade but all of our grades

if progress has been made
	then next jobs should be-
	Make menu selection and cart scenes - Nathan & Om
	Add in functionality for login and Account Creation - Johnny & Sophia
	Finish up context class, and help with other jobs as needed - Andrew
										(if help is needed just DM me)



Andrew's updates:

Data base now has all 10 food items.
Photos of food are in src/Photos

Ingreadents not added but it's in a word doc
^----- need someone to look-over/edit. food is complex and this short-list is stil a bit long

If we keep the ingreadents as is
	Then I recommend that we have a button for a popup window listing the ingreadents for each menu item

Context class skeleton added, will fill in when data objects are added

My task for next week is to research and add in sqlite queries
